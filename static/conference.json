Boring...\" When did you use TDD last time in your project? \"Well, my project is special. I cannot use TDD there\". I think you can! You can not? Try harder! In this presentation we will take the TDD we know already for a long time and bring it back to the future of our code. Let's not focus on the theory too much and let's practice TDD together with examples. We will go step by step, so if you aren't afraid of a lot of code then join me in this TDD time-travel."
