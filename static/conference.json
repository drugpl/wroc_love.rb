      "description": "Software engineer with 10+ years of experience. He started applications from scratch, dealt with legacy, and extracted services from a monolith and led teams.  Strong proponent of diving deep into black boxes, he focuses on distributed systems and database internals.  Has a strange hobby of writing regular expressions by hand and discussing their performance. Knowledge-sharing advocate: after work, he's a university instructor, public speaker and meetup organiser. Bookworm, hiker and history buff (ask him about Napoleon!)."
