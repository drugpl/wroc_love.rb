Strong proponent of diving deep into black boxes, he focuses on distributed systems and database internals.  Has a strange hobby of writing regular expressions by hand and discussing their performance. Knowledge-sharing advocate: after work, he's a university instructor, public speaker and meetup organiser. Bookworm, hiker and history buff (ask him about Napoleon!)."

I try to do what needs to be done while exercising my creativity and experiencing the ups and downs of the process. I prefer to use Unix, Ruby, and Open Source solutions. My curiosity led me to learn about security, privacy, cryptography, operating systems, networking, blockchains, and web-related fields. Privately, I enjoy contemplating classical paintings and sculptures. In my daily life, I try to apply principles of non-violent communication. I like to think about why people do what they do. I'm not sure what amazes me more: hard-core technology challenges or complexities of human nature."
